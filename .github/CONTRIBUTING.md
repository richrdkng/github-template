<p align="center">
  <b>Thank you for considering contributing to this project!</b>
</p>

<br/>

Before you doing so, **please read the following simple steps** on how to contribute. This will **make life easier and help to avoid wasting time** on things, which are not requested. ‚è≥

<br/>

## üìë	Get Familiar With The Project

Check out **in detail** the:

 - **`README.md`**, especially the **Usage** / **CLI** / **API** sections
 
 - **`package.json`** for **NPM scripts**, additional **configs**, and **dependencies**
 
 - **`src`** / **`lib`** / **`bin`** directories for **sources**, **structure**, and **naming conventions**

 - **`script`** directory and the **project's `root`** for **tools**, **scripts**, **tasks**, and **configs**

 - **`test`** directory for **tests**, the **test style**, and the **test process**

 - **`*.js`** / **`*.mjs`** files for **coding style** and **commenting style**, and get familiar with:
 
    - [![Code Style][badge-code]][url-code]

  - [**Issues**][url-issues] and [**Commits**][url-commits] for **commit styles**, the **release workflow**, and get familiar with:
  
    - [![Commit Style][badge-commit]][url-commit]    
    - [![Release Workflow][badge-release]][url-release]

<br/>

## üí°	Discuss The Change

 - **Search** open and closed issues **first before submitting a new one**. Existing issues often contain ***workarounds, resolutions, or progress updates***.

 - If you **couldn't find** the relevant issue, **open a** [**New Issue**][url-new-issue] by choosing the ***appropriate and relevant issue type***.
 
 - **Follow the guide** of the issue type you chose and **describe your contribution in detail** and what change would you like to make.

 - **Wait for feedback before continuing** to the next steps. ***However, if the issue is clear*** *(a tiny bug, a build, or a doc typo, etc)* and ***the fix is simple***, you can ***continue and fix it***.

<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Issues

 - [**Fork**][url-help-fork] **the project**, then:
 
   - **Clone your own fork**:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-template.git
     ```

   - Navigate into the project's directory, **configure the remote**, then **install the dependencies**:

     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/richrdkng/github-template.git
     npm install
     ```     

   - If you cloned a while ago, **get the latest changes** from upstream, then **update the dependencies**:

     ```bash
     git checkout master && git pull upstream master
     rm -rf node_modules && npm install
     ``` 
 
 - **Create a new branch** for your change using [**commitizen-style**][url-commit-style] naming convention **in dash-case**:

   - Use **this general template** for your branch names, notice `<scope>` is optional ***(omit ONLY, when you're working on a larger, or multifaceted change with several scopes)***:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b <type>-<scope?>-<subject>
     ```

   - General examples:

     ```bash
     # bugfix:
     git checkout -b fix-scope-short-imperative-tense-title

     # feature:
     git checkout -b feat-scope-short-imperative-tense-title

     # feature without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b feat-short-imperative-tense-title

     # doc change:
     git checkout -b docs-scope-short-imperative-tense-title
     ```

   - Specific examples:

     ```bash
     # bugfix:
     git checkout -b fix-homepage-fix-hero-typos     

     # feature:
     git checkout -b feat-backend-add-image-resizing

     # feature without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b feat-add-initial-image-upload

     # test:
     git checkout -b test-validation-add-middle-name-tests
     
     # test without scope (omitted):
     git checkout -b test-add-initial-form-tests
     ```
 
 - **Commit your changes** in that branch **in logical chunks**:
 
   - Make sure to adhere to [**commitizen**][url-commit-style] conventions, **otherwise your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project**. For your own convenience, you can run this NPM script for your commit messages:
   
     ```bash
     npm run commit
     ```

   - For **intermediate/small changes** ***(when you're not done yet with the particular fix/feature/test/etc., but you need to commit some changes)*** use the shorter `subject-body` format:

     ```
     <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     ```

     - Example:

       ```
       add initial dirs and files
  
       Add an initial .gitattributes file with initial, default content.
       Also add lib/ and src/ dirs with .gitkeep files.
       ```

   - For the **main change** ***(when you're done with your fix/feature/test/etc. change)*** use the proper [**commit message format**][url-commit-format]:

     ```
     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <breaking change>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <footer>
     ```

     - Example:

       ```
       fix(validator): fix middle name validation
 
       Fix the broken middle name validation, when choosing `detailed` name option
       for first, middle, and last name. Also add a boolean toggle for middle name validaton.
 
       Closes #42
       ```  
      
 - **Ensure consistency and quality** throughout all changes:

   - Follow and adhere to [**StandardJS**][url-code] coding style and make sure the **tests run without errors** by running:

     ```bash
     npm run check
     ```

   - Use Git's [**interactive rebase**][url-rebase] feature to tidy up your commits **before making them public**:

     ```bash
     git rebase --interactive [base]
     ```
   
 - **Then finally**:

   - In **`package.json`**, add yourself to the [**array of contributors**][url-npm-contrib-doc] *(create it if it doesn't exist)*:
   
     ```json   
     "contributors": [
       "Your Name <your@email.com> (www.yoursite.com)"
     ],  
     ``` 
 
   - Locally **merge** ***(or rebase)*** **the upstream branch** into your branch:

     ```bash
     git pull [--rebase] upstream master
     ```

   - **Push your branch** up to **your fork**:

     ```bash
     git push origin <your-branch-name>
     ```

<br/>

## üèÅ Submit A Pull Request

 - Open a pull request and **reference the initial issue** [**in the pull request message**][url-pull-req-help] 
   *(e.g.: fixes #42)*. Write a **good description and title**, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

 - **If it makes sense**, add screenshots, gifs, etc., so it will be easier to see what is going on.
 
 - Wait for [**Travis CI**][url-ci] to run all tests **without errors** and give you a [![CI][badge-ci]][url-ci] badge **on your own branch**. ***If Travis CI errors out, fix the issues, then commit and push again until all tests run without errors.***

 - For ambitious tasks, open a Pull Request as soon as possible with the [WIP] prefix in the title, in order to get feedback and help from the community.

 - Allow semantic-release maintainers to make changes to your Pull Request branch. This way, we can rebase it and make some minor changes if necessary. All changes we make will be done in new commit and we'll ask for your approval before merging them.

 - IMPORTANT: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the MIT License (if it includes code changes) and under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (if it includes documentation changes).
